Operations Closed on the Proper Dyadic Rationals:

Sign and Unary Agnostic:
- Min / Max
- Multiplication
- "Complement" (a + complement(a) = if a > 0 { 1 } else { -1 })

Unary Agnostic, Unsigned:
- Average (reason: avg(1/2, -1/2) = 0)

Unary Agnostic, Signed:
- Negation (reason: obvious)





multiplication impl:
(a / 2 ^ b) * (c / 2 ^ d) = (a * c) / 2 ^ (b + d)
